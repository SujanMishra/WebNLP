## ToDo and WIP

- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all features, including cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) compatibility with
  OpenAI, Anyscale etc as required.
- **Native Application Development**: If required, to handle CORS restrictions and manage local LLMs.
- **Visual Scripting Implementation**: For both RAG pipelines and Agent Networks.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Extending support to Firefox, addressing Manifest V2/V3 issues.
- **Comprehensive Development**: Covering all the planned features and functionalities.

## Pain Points

- **Browser Extension Limitations**: The current design restricts interaction with system apps, databases (except
  IndexedDB), and external APIs not supporting CORS, severely limiting the extension's capabilities.
- **Security and Compatibility Challenges**: Due to CORS and other security concerns, using external libraries is
  problematic, often necessitating writing code from scratch.
- **Browser-Specific Issues**: Currently, the extension works only with Chrome and Internet Explorer. Adding Firefox
  support is challenging due to manifest version differences.
- **Multimedia Constraints**: Directly capturing audio / video from system through the extension is not feasible without tunneling
  through a native app. Thou we can capture audio/video from any tab this limits us to web based services only, our aim is to be able to talk to Web NLP extention and give commands, as things etc.
